name: Retracing Human Genetic Histories and Natural Selection Using Precise Local
  Ancestry Inference
description: In an increasingly diverse world, including admixed individuals in genomic
  studies is imperative for equity and portability. A crucial first step is precise
  local ancestry inference (LAI). We have developed Orchestra, a LAI model with unprecedented
  accuracy, and trained on over 10,000 single-origin individuals from 35 worldwide
  populations. We employed Orchestra to delve into genetic relationships and demographic
  histories, with a focus on Latin Americans, a prime example of admixture, and the
  Ashkenazi Jewish, whose origins have long been debated. Finally, Orchestra enabled
  us to map signatures of selection, notably identifying trace Scandinavian ancestry
  in British samples and unveiling an immune-rich region linked to respiratory infections.
  Our work advances the field of LAI and holds promise for improvements in future
  applications for admixed populations.
